# Analyzing Airbnb Listing Descriptions

How did Airbnb owners adapt their listing descriptions to COVID-19?

The Airbnb market was significantly affected by the lockdown and travel restrictions in NYC starting March 2020. Our motivation behind this project was to understand the extent of damage to the NYC Airbnb market of pandemic-related restrictions, both on the demand and supply sides. Our questions ranged from how demand has changed to how hosts have adapted their listing strategies because of this. We used a combination of supervised, unsupervised models and text analysis to address our questions. Our results showed that post March 2020, hosts sharply adjusted their listing descriptions to contain pandemic related keywords and guestsâ€™ preferences for rooms skewed towards booking the whole place for themselves. This implies that COVID-19 definitively impacted supply and demand on the market. This caused changes both in customer preferences and host responses.
